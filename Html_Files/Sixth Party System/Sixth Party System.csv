burden fall least afford national productivity suffer value dollar continue fall world trade made good progress putting people back work past months created million new jobs american workers reduced unemployment rate percent continue efforts reduce unemployment especially among young people minorities must tell tonight inflation threatens progress get inflation control able reduce unemployment may even slide backward inflation obviously serious problem solution answers nobody perhaps complete adequate answer want let know fighting inflation central preoccupation mine months ahead want arouse nation join effort two simplistic familiar answers sometimes proposed simple familiar extreme one answers impose complicated scheme federal government wage price controls entire free economic system deliberate recession would throw millions people work extreme proposals would work must rejected spent many hours last months reviewing advisers number outside experts every proposal every suggestion every possibility eliminating inflation one thing learned beyond doubt single solution inflation instead number partial remedies help others may choice use best approaches maintain constant search additional steps may effective want discuss tonight approaches able develop involve action government business labor every sector economy factors control president--especially government actions-- insist government part job whether efforts successful finally depend much decisions--made every day service station grocery store business union meetings determine nation answer inflation much decisions made white house congress capitol hill cannot guarantee joint effort succeed fact almost certain succeed success means quick dramatic changes every free government earth wrestling problem inflation every one knows long term disease requires longterm treatment us make improvements even risk partial failure rather ensure failure trying concentrate efforts within government know government cause inflation one causes government set example therefore must take lead fiscal restraint going hold government spending reduce budget deficit eliminate government waste slash federal hiring cut federal work force eliminate needless regulations bring competition back economy oppose reduction federal income taxes convincing prospects inflation controlled let explain one steps means federal deficit high people simply sick tired wasteful federal spending inflation brings already success brought deficit one third since ran president-- billion fiscal year billion fiscal year -- reduction billion federal deficit years keep going next year tough restraints federal spending moderate economic growth prospect plan reduce budget deficit less one half ran office-- billion less government spending great portion nation produces campaign promised cut government share total national spending percent percent fiscal year plan meet goal year earlier reducing deficit require difficult unpleasant decisions must face time national austerity hard choices necessary want avoid consequences even worse intend make hard choices already vetoed bills would undermine fight inflation congress sustained vetoes know congress continue cooperate effort meet needs responsible noninflationary ways use administrative budgetary powers office including veto necessary keep nation firmly path fiscal restraint restraint involves tax policy well spending decisions tax reduction never politically popular today future tax cuts made rashly eye budget deficits hurt us causing inflation tax cuts could directly lower costs prices help fight inflation may consider ways reduce particular taxes still cutting budget deficit convincing prospect controlling inflation oppose reductions federal income taxes keep government manageable size ordering tonight cut federal hiring order mean reduction number permanent federal employees already budgeted fiscal year cut total size federal work force already placed percent cap pay increase federal employees federal executive officers receiving pay increases enough control government deficits spending hiring must also control costs government regulations recent years congress passed number landmark statutes improve social environmental conditions must continue progress toward protecting health safety american people must also realize everything price consumers eventually pick tab regulations essential must efficient fight inflation encouraged unnecessary removed early year directed federal agencies eliminate unnecessary regulations analyze costs benefits new ones today instance occupational safety health administration sometimes called osha eliminated nearly unnecessary regulations build progress directed council regulatory departments agencies coordinate regulations prevent overlapping duplication important council develop unified calendar planned major regulations calendar give us first time comprehensive list regulations federal government proposing costs objectives president personally use authority ensure regulations issued needed meet goals lowest possible cost also cutting away regulatory thicket grown around us giving competitive free enterprise system chance grow place last year gave airline industry fresh shot competition regulations removed free market forces drove prices record numbers passengers traveled profits went new airline deregulation bill make benefits permanent first time decades actually deregulated major industry next year work congress bring competition others railroad trucking industries weapons inflation competition powerful without real competition prices wages go even demand going must therefore work allow competition wherever possible powerful groups--government business labor must think twice abusing economic power redouble efforts put competition back american free enterprise system another reason inflation slowdown productivity growth efficient production essential control inflation make american goods competitive world markets add new jobs increase real incomes people made start toward improving productivity tax bill passed congress includes many investment incentives recommended last january federal support research development continue increase especially basic research coordinate strengthen federal programs support productivity improvements throughout economy government efforts attack inflation hurts inflation essentials--food housing medical care continue use agricultural policies sustain farm production maintain stable prices keep inflation rising interest rates always accompanied inflation add costs business expansion consumers must pay buy houses consumer items burden controlling inflation cannot left monetary policy alone must deal problem tight restrictions money credit push interest rates work balanced concerted sustained program tight budget restraint private wage price moderation responsible monetary policy support successful expect lower inflation lower interest rates consumers businesses alike medical care costs gone much faster general inflation rate important step take pass strong bill control hospital costs year senate passed one next year try believe whole congress act hold hospital costs-- members congress hear january new congress convenes preparing package specific legislative proposals help fight inflation government part country like government cannot job alone end success failure effort also rest whether private sector accept act -- voluntary wage price standards announcing tonight standards fair standards everyone follow follow slow prices wages chase prices stay even point way toward eventual cure inflation removing pressures cause first

penetrating recession since second world war recession resulted time briefest since second world war addition brought inflation earlier year first quarter severe inflation pressure brought opec price increase averaged percent first quarter year second quarter dropped percent recent figures last months third quarter year inflation rate percent -- still high illustrates vividly addition providing enormous number jobs -- million new jobs last years -- inflationary threat still urgent us noticed governor reagan recently mentioned reagan kemp roth proposal running mate george bush described voodoo economics said would result percent inflation rate business week democratic publication said reagan kemp roth proposal -- quote think completely irresponsible would result inflationary

ayatollah whether united states power right try determine form government country back unpopular regimes whose major merit friendly united states governor reagan degree unpopularity regime choice total authoritarianism -- totalitarianism say alternative government makes one wonder whether helpful people guilty someone meet exactly standards human rights even though ally instead trying

question candidates answered candidates two opportunities follow question rebut comment opponent statement governor reagan respond section first question marvin stone strategic arms limitation mr stone governor reagan arms control president said single important issue expressed desire end nuclear arms race russia methods vastly different suggest scrap salt ii treaty already negotiated intensify buildup american power induce soviets sign new treaty one favorable us governor reagan yes mr stone president carter hand says try convince reluctant congress ratify present treaty grounds best hope get cannot right tell us think governor reagan yes think right believe must consistent foreign policy strong america strong economy build national security restore margin safety time try restrain soviet buildup going forward rapid pace quite time salt ii treaty result negotiations mr carter team entered asked soviet union discussion actual reduction nuclear strategic weapons emissary think came home hours heard definite yet taking one soviet union went back negotiations terms mr carter canceled b bomber delayed mx delayed trident submarine delayed cruise missile shut minuteman missile production line whatever things might done soviet union sat table knowing gone forward unilateral concessions without reciprocation whatsoever blocked salt ii treaty mr carter mr mondale suggest blocked senate democratic majority indeed senate armed services committee voted abstentions salt ii treaty declared national security interests united states besides illegal law land passed congress says cannot accept treaty equal equal treaty one reason alone b bombers considered strategic weapons backfire bombers mr smith governor interrupt point time question president carter mr stone yes president carter expressed desire end nuclear arms race russia vastly different methods governor suggests scrap salt ii treaty signed vienna -- intensify buildup american power induce soviets sign new treaty one favorable us hand say try convince reluctant congress ratify present treaty grounds best hope get russians cannot right tell us think president yes glad inflation unemployment cities important issues pale insignificance life duties president compared control nuclear weapons every president served oval office since harry truman dedicated proposition controlling nuclear weapons negotiate soviet union -- balanced controlled observable reducing levels atomic weaponry disturbing pattern attitude governor reagan never supported arms control agreements -- limited test ban salt antiballistic missile treaty vladivostok treaty negotiated soviet union president ford -- wants throw wastebasket treaty control nuclear weapons balanced equal basis soviet union negotiated year period two republican predecessors senate voted yet strategic arms limitation treaty preliminary skirmishings committees senate treaty never come floor senate either debate vote understandable senator preliminary debates make irresponsible statement maybe ill advised statement got senators correct mistake mistake man hopes president says take treaty discard vote debate explore issues finally capitalize long negotiation -- dangerous disturbing thing mr smith governor reagan opportunity rebut governor reagan yes like respond much first soviet union -- critical previous agreements outnegotiated quite long time managed spite attempts arms limitation go forward biggest military buildup history man suggest two republican presidents tried pass salt treaty -- puts side -- would like say president ford within percent treaty could agreement left office emphatically salt treaty would like point also senators like henry jackson hollings south carolina -- taking lead fight particular treaty talking scrapping talking taking treaty back going back negotiations would say soviet union sit negotiate long takes legitimate arms limitation reduction nuclear weapons point neither one us represents threat hardly throwing away treaty opposed arms limitation mr smith president carter president yes governor reagan making misleading disturbing statements advocates scrapping treaty -- know men quotes treaty final form -- also advocates possibility said missing element playing trump card soviet union nuclear arms race insisting upon nuclear superiority nation predication negotiation future soviet union president brezhnev said scrap treaty negotiated three american presidents year period time insist upon nuclear superiority basis future negotiations believe launching nuclear arms race good basis future negotiations obvious president americans would reject proposition would mean resumption dangerous nuclear arms race would disturbing american people would change basic tone commitment nation experienced ever since second world war presidents democratic republican would also disturbing allies support nuclear arms treaty addition adversarial relationship soviet union would undoubtedly deteriorate rapidly attitude extremely dangerous belligerent tone although said quiet voice mr smith governor reagan governor reagan know president supposed replying sometimes hard time connecting saying said positions sometimes think like witch doctor gets mad good doctor comes along cure work point made already mr president regard negotiating call nuclear superiority part united states calls mutual reduction weapons say neither us represent threat suggest salt ii treaty negotiators negotiated continuation based preceding efforts two previous presidents true new negotiation say president ford within percent solution could acceptable think allies would happy go along fair verifiable salt agreement mr smith president carter last word question president think close discussion would better put perspective talking discussion daughter amy day came ask important issue said thought nuclear weaponry control nuclear arms formidable force weapons megatons explosion put tons tnt one railroad cars would trainload tnt stretching across nation one major war explosion warhead thousands equivalent megaton million tons tnt warheads control weapons single major responsibility president cast commitment presidents slight technicalities corrected dangerous approach mr smith go another question harry ellis president carter energy mr ellis mr president said americans conservation importing much less oil today even year ago yet u dependence arab oil percentage total imports today much higher time arab oil embargo time come loss substantial amounts arab oil could plunge u depression means bridge must built dependence united states develop synthetic fuels alternative energy sources without damage environment process mean steadily higher fuel bills american families president think doubt future cost oil going go basic commitment since president reduce dependence foreign oil done two ways one conserve energy stop waste energy secondly produce american energy successful cases reduced importing foreign oil last year alone onethird imported today million barrels oil less day year ago commitment opening bright vista nation future windfall profits tax base opportunity use american technology american ability american natural resources expand rapidly production synthetic fuels yes expand rapidly production solar energy yes also produce conventional kinds american energy drill oil gas wells year year history produce coal year year history exporting coal year year history opportunity improved transportation systems improved loading facilities ports see good opportunity world international market replace opec oil american coal basic energy source exciting future give us energy security also open vast opportunities americans live better life millions new jobs associated new dynamic industry prospect new energy policy put effect mr smith would repeat question governor reagan mr ellis governor reagan americans conservation importing much less oil today even year ago yet u reliance arab oil percentage total imports much higher today arab oil embargo substantial loss arab oil could plunge united states depression question whether development alternative energy sources order reduce dependence done without damaging environment mean american families steadily higher fuel bills governor reagan sure means steadily higher fuel costs believe nation portrayed long time people energy poor energy rich coal president mentioned yes yet one eighth total coal resources utilized right mines closed miners work due regulations either interfere mining prevent burning modern technology yes burn coal within limits clean air act think technology improves able even better thing leased begun explore percent outer continental

powerplants planned country -- let add word safety must done utmost safety given canceled plans build government regulations permits forth make take twice long build nuclear plant united states build one japan western europe sources energy rich coal one great potentials mr smith president carter comment president yes sir repeat year opportunity realize produce million tons coal -- unequaled record history country governor reagan says good achievement blames restraints coal production regulations -- regulations affect life health safety miners also regulations protect purity air quality water land cannot cast aside regulations chance next years insisting upon health safety workers mines also preserving high air water pollution standards triple amount coal produce governor reagan approach energy policy already proven effectiveness repeal change substantially windfall profits tax return major portion billion back oil companies away department energy shortcircuit synthetic fuels program put minimal emphasis solar power emphasize strongly nuclear powerplants major source energy future wants put eggs one basket give basket major oil companies mr smith governor reagan governor reagan misstatement course position happen believe free enterprise better job producing things people need government department energy multibillion dollar budget excess billion produced quart oil lump coal anything else line energy mr carter suggest want away safety laws laws pertain clean water clean air forth governor california took charge passing strictest air pollution laws united states -- strictest air quality law ever adopted united states created osha occupational safety health agency protection employees federal government one place day one decisions rulings ever challenged think charges missing point suggesting literally thousands unnecessary regulations invade every facet business indeed much personal lives unnecessary government without added billion cost production country contributing part inflation would like see us little free mr smith president carter another crack president sure matter fact air pollution standard laws passed california passed objections governor reagan well known fact also recently someone suggested occupational safety health act abolished governor reagan responded amen offshore drilling rights question governor reagan raises often matter fact proposal alaska lands legislation percent offshore lands would open exploration percent alaska lands suspected believed minerals might exist year plan leasing offshore lands proposed land drilled opened drilling since program first started putting restraints american exploration encouraging every way mr smith governor reagan last word question governor reagan yes wellknown fact opposed air pollution laws california thing possibly think president must suggesting law federal government tried impose state california -- law regulations would made impossible drive automobile within city
