elimination income tax deferral united states earnings industrialized countries enhance relative attraction investment less developed countries hand recommend elimination tax device anywhere world even underdeveloped countries elimination tax deferral privileges forms activities trading licensing insurance others typically seek tax methods operation valid reason permit remaining untaxed

structural defects next recommend number measures remove serious defects income tax structure changes making beginning toward comprehensive tax reform program mentioned provide sufficient revenue gains offset cost investment tax credit keep revenue producing potential tax structure intact withholding interest dividends system combined withholding voluntary reporting wages salaries individual income tax served us well introduced war income tax extended millions new taxpayers wage withholding system one important successful advances tax system recent times initial difficulties quickly overcome new system helped taxpayer less tax collector unfortunate therefore application withholding principle remained incomplete withholding apply dividends interest result substantial amounts

interest pay tax less receive wage salary income tax paid promptly large continued avoidance tax part steadily demoralizing effect compliance others gap reporting appreciably lessened educational programs effectively closed intensified enforcement measures except expenditure inordinate amounts time money withholding corporate dividends investment type interest interest paid taxable government corporate securities savings accounts necessary practicable therefore recommend enactment legislation provide withholding rate corporate dividends taxable investment type interest effective january

largely solving compliance problem taxpayers receiving dividends interest steps also taken avoid hardships recipients subject tax remaining need compliance largely high income group subject higher tax

withholding enactment proposal estimated increase revenue million per year repeal dividend credit exclusion present law provides exclusion income first dividends received domestic corporations credit tax dividend income excess provisions enacted proponents argued would encourage capital formation equity investment would provide partial offset called double taxation dividend income clear serve neither purpose well therefore recommend repeal dividend credit exclusion dividend credit exclusion efficient stimulus capital expansion form plant equipment revenue losses resulting provisions spread large volume outstanding shares rather concentrated new shares stimulating effects provisions thus greatly diluted resulting relatively little increases supply equity funds relatively slight reduction cost equity financing fact reduction occur likely benefit large corporations easy access capital market little use small firms favorably situated insofar raising profitability new investment plant

double taxation whatever may merits arguments respecting existence double taxation provisions act clearly offer appropriate remedy greatly overcompensate dividend recipient high income bracket giving either insufficient relief shareholders smaller income point deserves emphasis viewed simply means tax reduction dividend credit wholly inequitable distribution benefits highly favorable taxpayers upper income groups receive major part dividend income percent dividend income accrues incomes percent accrues taxpayers whose incomes exceed year similarly dividend income sharply rising fraction total income move income scale thus dividend income percent income sources taxpayers incomes constitutes percent income income percent incomes role dividend credit confused broader question tax rates applicable high incomes high rates deserve examination one problems examined context next year tax reform top bracket rates reduced dividend credit way rate reductions appropriate apply less high incomes sources professional salaried people whose tax position particularly difficult today credit eliminated exclusion also discarded similar reasons tax saving exclusion substantially greater

administration prices pay find prices pay went five times much truman administration eisenhower administration net result means average family income went fifteen per cent eisenhower years two per cent truman years standing still good record may emphasize enough record never something stand something build building record believe secret progress know way progress think first record proves know way senator kennedy suggested believes knows way respect sincerity makes suggestion hand look various programs offers seem new seem simply retreads programs truman administration preceded would suggest course evening might indicate areas programs new mean progress kind programs programs expand educational opportunities give americans equal chance education things necessary dear hearts people programs addition see medical care aged much much better handled present time may indicate senator kennedy disagreement aims want help old people want see adequate medical care question means think means advocate reach goal better means advocates could give better examples whatever whether field housing health medical care schools eh development electric power programs believe move america move forward build wonderful record made past seven half years look programs might suggest evaluating often tendency say test program much spending concede areas referred senator kennedy would spe federal government spend would spend costed cost democratic platform runs minimum thirteen two tenths billions dollars year presently spending maximum eighteen billion dollars year presently spending republican platform cost cost minimum four billion dollars year maximum four nine tenths billion dollar year presently spending mean program better question much federal government spends question government question administration right thing case believe programs stimulate creative energies hundred eighty million free americans believe programs senator kennedy advocates tendency stifle creative energies believe words program would lead stagnation motive power need country get progress final point would like make senator kennedy suggested speeches lack compassion poor old others unfortunate let us understand throughout campaign motives mine sincere know means poor know means see people unemployed know senator kennedy feels deeply problems disagreement goals america means reach goals mr smith thank mr nixon completes opening statements candidates answer questions comment upon one another answers questions put correspondents networks correspondents introducing sander vanocur nbc news charles warren mutual news stuart novins cbs news bob fleming abc news first question senator kennedy mr fleming mr fleming senator vice president campaign said naive times immature raised question leadership issue think people vote rather vice president mr kennedy well vice president came congress together served labor committee fourteen years period time experience uh government comparable secondly think question uh programs advocate party record lead come democratic party century produced woodrow wilson franklin roosevelt harry truman supported sustained programs discussed tonight mr nixon comes republican party nominated fact last twenty five years republican leadership opposed federal aid education medical care aged development tennessee valley development natural resources think mr nixon effective leader party hope would grant question us point view party want lead united states mr smith mr nixon would like comment statement mr nixon comment mr smith next question mr novins mr novins mr vice president campaign stresses value eight year experience question arises whether experience observer participant initiator policy making would tell us please specifically major proposals made last eight years adopted administration mr nixon would rather difficult cover eight two half minutes would suggest proposals could mentioned first foreign trips made recommendations adopted example first trip abroad abroad strongly recommended increase exchange programs particularly related exchange persons leaders labor field information field trip south america made recommendations separate inter american lending agency set south american nations would like much better lend participate lending agencies treated countries world uh made recommendations trips example trip abroad hungary made recommendations regard hungarian refugee situation adopted president enacted law congress within administration chairman president committee price stability economic growth opportunity make recommendations adopted within administration think reasonably effective know senator kennedy suggested speech cleveland yesterday committee particularly effective would suggest take credit would presume since committee formed price line held well within united states mr kennedy well would say latter found uh somewhat unsatisfactory figures uh mr nixon used previous speech talked truman administration mr truman came office nineteen uh forty four end war uh difficulties facing united states period transition price controls lifted rather difficult use overall figure taking seven half years comparing last eight years prefer take overall percentage record last twenty years democrats eight years republicans show overall period growth regard uh price stability uh aware committee produce recommendations ever certainly congress point view legislation regard controlling prices regard exchange students labor unions chairman subcommittee africa think one unfortunate phases policy towards country minute number exchanges think true latin america also come forward program students congo three hundred federal government africa previous year think uh moved least two areas sufficient vigor mr smith next question senator kennedy mr warren mr warren uh senator kennedy brief speech minutes ago mentioned farm surpluses mr kennedy correct mr warren like ask fact think presidential candidates traditionally make promises farmers lots people think understand government pays farmers producing certain crops paying farmers overproduce matter let ask sir farmer operate like business man operates factory auto company overproduces certain model car uncle sam step buy surplus constant courting farmer mr kennedy well think federal government moved program withdrew supports uh think would complete uh economic chaos farmer plants spring harvests fall hundreds thousands really able control market well bring crops livestock many time purchasers buy milk hogs large companies many cases therefore farmer position bargain effectively market place think experience twenties shown free market could agriculture agricultural economy collapses economy rest united states sooner later collapse farmers number one market automobile industry united states automobile industry number one market steel farmers economy continues decline sharply recent years think would recession rest country think case government intervention good one secondly objection present farm policy effective controls bring supply demand better balance dropping support price order limit production work highest uh surpluses nine billion dollars worth uh higher tax load treasury farmer last years lowest farm income many years think farm policy failed judgment policy work effective supply demand balance done governmental action therefore suggest basic commodities supported federal government endorsement farmers commodity attempt bring supply demand balance attempt effective production controls five six per cent surplus breaks price fifteen twenty per cent think mr benson program failed must say reading vice president speech farmers read mine believe much different mr benson think provides effective governmental controls think support prices tied average market price last three years mr benson theory therefore believe sharp enough breach past give us hope success future mr smith mr nixon comment mr nixon course disagree senator kennedy insofar suggestions done uh farm program made suggestion need move direction government controls suggestion would also mean raising prices uh consumers pay products im imposing upon farmers uh controls acreage even far today think wrong direction think worked past think work future program advocated one departs present program respect recognizes government responsibility get farmer trouble presently government got fundamental reason let farmer go present time farmer produced surpluses government asked legislation war surpluses responsibility indemnify farmer period get rid farmer uh surpluses get surpluses farmer back however program announced see farm income holds would propose holding income type program senator kennedy suggested would raise prices one would indemnify farmer pay farmer kind uh products surplus mr smith next question vice president nixon mr vanocur mr vanocur uh mr vice president since question executive leadership important campaign issue like follow mr novins question republican campaign slogans see signs around country last week say experience counts picture sir uh implying governmental executive decision making uh experience uh opponent news conference august twenty fourth president eisenhower asked give one example major idea adopted reply quoting give week might think one remember month ago sir president brought since wondering sir clarify version correct one put republican campaign leaders one put president eisenhower mr nixon well would suggest mr vanocur uh know president probably facetious remark uh would also suggest insofar statement concerned think would improper president united states disclose uh instances members official family made recommendations made years accepted rejected president always maintained properly entitled get advice wants cabinet advisers without disclosing anybody including matter fact congress say years sat national security council cabinet met legislative leaders met president made great decisions regard lebanon quemoy matsu matters president asked advice given sometimes advice taken sometimes say made decisions would say president ever allow anybody else make major decisions president makes decisions advisers give counsel asks far experience counts whether experience counts say uh say experience people consider senator kennedy people consider pointed came congress year experience different mine mine executive branch legislative branch would say people opportunity evaluate mine think going abide whatever people decide mr smith senator kennedy mr kennedy well say question experience question also uh judgment future goals united states ability implement goals abraham lincoln came presidency rather little known uh session house representatives defeated senate fifty eight distinguished president certain road presidency guarantees uh take uh one road another successful president congress fourteen years voted last uh eight years uh vice president uh presiding senate meeting responsibilities met met uh decisions eight hundred times matters affect domestic security united states member senate foreign relations committee question really candidate party meet problems united states going face sixties mr smith next question senator kennedy mr novins mr novins senator kennedy connection problems future speak program enunciated earlier direct talk call expanding welfare programs schools teacher salaries medical care forth also call reducing federal debt wondering president january would go paying bill mean mr kennedy indicate advocate reducing federal debt believe going able reduce federal debt much nineteen sixty one two three think heavy obligations affect security going meet therefore never suggested uh able retire debt substantially even nineteen sixty one two mr novins senator believe one speeches mr kennedy never mr novins suggested reducing interest rate would help toward mr kennedy reducing interest mr novins reduction federal debt mr kennedy reducing interest rate judgment hard money tight money policy fiscal policy administration contributed slow economy helped bring recession fifty four made recession fifty eight rather intense slowed somewhat economic activity talked however kind programs talked judgment uh fiscally sound medical care aged would put social security vice president disagree program javits nixon nixon javits program would cost fully used uh six hundred million dollars government per year six hundred million dollars state program advocated failed five votes united states senate would put medical care aged social security would paid social security system social security tax secondly support federal aid education federal aid teachers salaries think good investment think going think heap burden property tax already strained many communities provide make sh insure opinion many children adequately educated many teachers adequately compensated greater return economy society educational system second none question development natural resources would pay go sense would balanced power revenues would bring back sufficient money finance projects way tennessee valley believe balanced budget conditions would unbalance budget would grave national emergency serious recession otherwise steady rate economic growth mr nixon mr rockefeller meeting said five per cent economic growth would bring ten billion dollars extra tax revenues whatever brought think finance essential programs within balanced budget business remains orderly mr smith mr nixon comment mr nixon yes think mr novins referring one senator kennedy speeches democratic platform mention cutting national debt think pointed course possible particularly proposals senator kennedy advocated either cut national debt reduce taxes matter fact necessary raise taxes senator kennedy points far one proposal concerned one medical care aged would financed social security however raising taxes pay social security points would make pay go basis natural resources development natural resources development also support incidentally however whenever uh uh uh appropriates money one projects pay appropriate money eh eventually pay mean government put money year would say proposals senator kennedy made result one two things either raise taxes unbalance budget unbalances budget means inflation course cruel blow people older people talking far aid school construction concerned favor senator kennedy january year said favored rather aid teacher salaries favor believe best way aid schools without running risk whatever federal government telling teachers teach mr smith next question vice president nixon mr warren mr warren mr vice president mentioned schools yesterday think asked crash program raise education standards evening talked advances education mr vice president said back salaries paid school teachers nothing short national disgrace higher salaries teachers added important situation corrected could lead national disaster yet refused vote senate order break tie vote single vote yes would granted salary increases teachers wonder could explain sir mr nixon awfully glad ge got question know got last question able complete argument uh think reason voted federal government uh pay teachers salaries probably reason concerned senator kennedy january year kick press conference said favored aid school construction time feel aid teachers salaries least way read remarks question federal government aiding teachers salaries senator kennedy take position take took take reason want higher teachers salaries need higher teachers salaries also want education free federal control federal government gets power pay teachers inevitably opinion acquire power set standards tell teachers teach think would bad country think would bad teaching profession another point made favor higher salaries teachers senator kennedy said january year press conference way get higher salaries teachers support school construction means local school districts various states money freed raise standards teachers salaries also point put responsibility federal government paying portion teachers salaries local communities states going meet responsibility much believe words seen local communities state assuming responsibility teachers salaries fortunately gone fifty percent last eight years thirty four percent rise salaries enough believe way get salaries teachers federal government get massive program objection cost dollars objection potential cost controls eventual freedom american people giving federal government power education greatest power government mr smith senator kennedy comment mr kennedy uh vice president quotes january sixty believe federal government pay directly teachers salaries issue senate february issue senate money would given state state could determine whether money would spent school construction teacher salaries question vice president disagreed voted favor proposal supported strongly think provided assistance teachers salaries without chance federal control vote th mr nixon disagreed tie vote uh defeated breaking tie defeated proposal want federal government paying teachers salaries directly money go states states determine whether shall go school construction teachers salaries opinion protect local authority school board school committee therefore think sound proposal supported regret pass secondly statements made uh democratic platform would cost good deal money favor unbalancing budget wholly wrong wholly error fact last eight years democratic congress reduced appropri requests appropriations ten billion dollars view think ought stated clearly record view programs carefully drawn within balanced budget economy moving ahead mr smith next question senator kennedy mr vanocur mr vanocur senator promising voters elected president try push congress bills medical aid aged comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill federal aid education august post convention session congress least held possibility could one day president overwhelming majorities especially senate could get action bills feel able get january mr kennedy well take bills mr vanocur able get august mr kennedy may take bills pass senate bill uh provide dollar twenty five cent minimum wage failed house

whether america moves whether federal government plus state government plus local government plus biggest segment individual enterprise moves example gross national product approximately five hundred billion dollars roughly hundred billion hundred quarter billion result government activity four hundred billion approximately result individuals reason eisenhower administration moved reason funds example locally build schools hospitals highways make progress administration encouraged individual enterprise resulted greatest expansion private sector economy ever witnessed eight year period growth growth looking growth administration supported policies stimulated mr smith senator kennedy mr kennedy well must say reason schools constructed local school districts willing increase property taxes tremendously high figure opinion almost point diminishing returns order sustain schools secondly think rich uh country think powerful country think however president leadership set country
